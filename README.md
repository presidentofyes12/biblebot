# biblebot
A bot similar to alexa

To run this program, run the following commands:

```
pip install speech_recognition
pip install pyaudio
pip install pyttsx3
pip install pywhatkit
pip install datetime
pip install wikipedia
pip install pyjokes
```

This will install the libraries needed to run the bot. Then, make sure you have a microphone.

Run the main.py program, and if you hear, "I'm Bob, what do you want from me?", then the program is working.

From there, you can tell Bob to do things, like playing a YouTube video:

> "Bob, play Ariana Grande"

Or telling you information about a person, place, thing or event:

> "Bob, tell me about/what was Hurricane Mitch"
